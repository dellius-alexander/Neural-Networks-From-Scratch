    "## Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic multilayer perceptron has multiple interconnected `perceptrons`, such as units that are organized in different sequential layers (`input layer`, one or more `hidden layers`, and an `output layer`). Each unit of a layer is connected to all units of the `next layer`. First, the information is presented to the `input layer`, then we use it to compute the output (or `activation`), $y_i$, for each unit of the first hidden layer. We propagate forward, with the output as input for the next layers in the network (hence feedforward), and so on until we reach the output. The most common way to train Neural Networks is by using `gradient descent` in combination with `backpropagation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the `hidden layers` as an abstract representation of the input data. This is the way the Neural Network understands the features of the data with its internal logic. However, Neural Networks are `non-interpretable models`. This means that if we observe the $y_i$ activations of the `hidden layer`, we wouldn’t be able to understand them. For us, they are just a `vector of numerical values`. We need the output layer to bridge the gap between the network’s representation and the actual data we’re interested in. You can think of this as a `translator`; we use it to understand the network’s logic, and at the same time, we can convert it into the actual target values that we are interested in.\n",

    "### Hidden Layer Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Input layer `A` has 4 features into 2 hidden layers with 3 neurons each. Each neuron has 4 weights and 1 bias. The output of the hidden layer is a $3x3$ matrix. The output of the hidden layer is passed to the output layer is a $3x3$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: inputs to layers are either inputs from the actual dataset you’re training with or outputs from a previous layer.**\n"
